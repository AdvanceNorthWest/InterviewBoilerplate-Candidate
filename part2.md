### Section 3: Technical Discussion (15 minutes)

Be prepared to discuss the following topics:

#### Scaling Question
> "If this table grows to 1 million rows, your `GET /tasks` query will become slow. How would you fix that without deleting data?"

#### Schema Question
> "You stored priority as 'High'/'Low' strings. Why might an Integer (1, 2, 3) be better for database performance?"

#### Conflict Question
> "User A and User B both load the list. User A deletes a task. User B tries to mark that same task as 'Done' 5 seconds later. What happens in your current implementation?"
